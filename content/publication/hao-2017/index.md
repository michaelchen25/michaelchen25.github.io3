abstract: The sensitivities of solid-phase immunoassays are limited by the quantity
  of detection antibodies bound to their antigens on the solid phase. Here, we developed
  a poly-protein G-expressing bacterium as an antibody-trapping microparticle to enhance
  the signals of immunoassays by increasing the accumulation of detection antibodies
  on the given antigen. Eight tandemly repeated fragment crystallisable (Fc) binding
  domains of protein G were stably expressed on the surface of Escherichia coli BL21
  cells (termed BL21/8G). BL21/8G cells showed a higher avidity for trapping antibodies
  on their surface than monomeric protein G-expressing BL21 (BL21/1G) cells did. In
  the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), simply mixing the detection
  antibody with BL21/8G provided a detection limit of 6 pg/mL for human interferon-$α$
  (IFN-$α$) and a limit of 30 pg/mL for polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated IFN-$α$
  (Pegasys), which are better than that of the traditional ELISA (30 pg/mL for IFN-$α$
  and 100 pg/mL for Pegasys). Moreover, the sensitivity of the Western blot for low-abundance
  Pegasys (0.4 ng/well) was increased by 25 folds upon mixing of an anti-PEG antibody
  with BL21/8G cells. By simply being mixed with a detection antibody, the poly-protein
  G-expressing bacteria can provide a new method to sensitively detect low-abundance
  target molecules in solid-phase immunoassays.
