abstract: An insufficient amount of detection antibodies bound to their antigens usually
  limits the sensitivity of immunoassays. Here, we describe a simple method to improve
  the detection limit and sensitivity of various immunoassays by mixing detection
  antibodies with a soluble poly protein G (named 8pG). 8pG was developed by fusing
  eight repeated fragment crystallizable (Fc) binding domains of streptococcal protein
  G to a linear polymer. Simply mixing detection antibodies with 8pG to form an antibody/8pG
  complex largely increased the accumulation of detection antibody to target molecules,
  which dramatically enhanced the sensitivity in direct ELISA, sandwich ELISA, Western
  blot, and flow cytometry systems, separately. The detection limit of Western blot
  for low-abundance PEGylated interferon (Pegasys) and recombinant human CTLA4 (rhCTLA4)
  improved by at least 13-fold and 31-fold, respectively, upon mixing detection antibodies
  with 8pG. Moreover, the nanoscale size of the antibody/8pG complex did not influence
  the granularity and dimension of target cells in the flow cytometry system. Collectively,
  we provide a quick and easy-to-operate method to make various immunoassays to sensitively
  detect low-abundance target molecules by just mixing their detection antibodies
  with 8pG.
