abstract: The sensitivity of traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
  is limited by the low binding avidity and heterogeneous orientation of capture antibodies
  coated on polystyrene-based microplates. Here, we developed a highly sensitive ELISA
  strategy by fixing poly-protein G-expressing cells on microplates to improve the
  coating amount and displayed orientation of capture antibodies. One or eight repeated
  fragment crystallisable (Fc) binding domains of protein G are stably expressed on
  the surface of BALB/c 3T3 cells (termed 1pG cells or 8pG cells), which then act
  as highly antibody-trapping microparticles. The 8pG cells showed higher antibody-trapping
  ability than the 1pG cells did. The antibody-coating amount of the 8pG cell-based
  microplates was 1.5–23 times and 1.2–6.8 times higher than that of traditional polystyrene-based
  and commercial protein G-based microplates, respectively. The 8pG cell-based microplates
  were then applied to an anti-IFN-$α$ sandwich ELISA and an anti-CTLA4 competitive
  ELISA, respectively, and dramatically enhanced their detection sensitivity. Importantly,
  direct coating unpurified capture antibody produced by mammalian cells did not impair
  the antigen-capturing function of 8pG cell-based microplates. The 8pG cell-based
  microplates exhibited a significant improvement in antibody-coating amount and preserved
  the homogeneous orientation of capture antibodies, making them a potential replacement
  for traditional microplates in various formats of ELISAs.
