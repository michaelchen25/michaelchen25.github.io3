abstract: Intestinal bacterial $β$-glucuronidase ($β$G) hydrolyzes glucuronidated
  metabolites to their toxic form in intestines, resulting in intestinal damage. The
  development of a method to inhibit $β$G is thus important but has been limited by
  the difficulty of directly assessing enzyme activity in live animals. Here, we utilized
  a fluorescent probe, fluorescein di-$β$-D-glucuronide (FDGlcU), to non-invasively
  image the intestinal bacterial $β$G activity in nude mice. In vitro cell-based assays
  showed that the detection limit is 104 colony-forming units/well of $β$G-expressing
  bacteria, and that 7.81 ng/mL of FDGlcU is enough to generate significant fluorescent
  signal. In whole-body optical images of nude mice, the maximum fluorescence signal
  for $β$G activity in intestines was detected 3 hours after gavage with FDGlcU. Following
  pretreatment with a bacterial $β$G inhibitor, the fluorescence signal was significantly
  reduced in abdomens and excised intestines images. For a 4-day antibiotic treatment
  to deplete intestinal bacteria, the FDGlcU-based images showed that the $β$G activity
  was decreased by 8.5-fold on day 4 and then gradually increased after treatment
  stopped. The results suggested that FDGlcU-based imaging revealed the in vitro and
  in vivo activity of intestinal bacterial $β$G, which would facilitate pharmacodynamic
  studies of specific bacterial $β$G inhibitors in animal studies.
