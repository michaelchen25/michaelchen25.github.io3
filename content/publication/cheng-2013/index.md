abstract: Attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) to proteins can mask immune epitopes
  to increase serum half-life, reduce immunogenicity, and enhance in vivo biological
  efficacy. However, PEGylation mediated epitope-masking may also limit sensitivity
  and accuracy of traditional ELISA. We previously described an anti-PEG-based sandwich
  ELISA for universal assay of PEGylated molecules. Here, we compared the quantitative
  assessment of PEGylated interferons by anti-PEG and traditional anti-interferon
  sandwich ELISA. The detection limits for PEG-Intron (12k-PEG) and Pegasys (40k-PEG)
  were 1.9 and 0.03 ng/mL for anti-PEG ELISA compared to 0.18 and 0.42 ng/mL for traditional
  anti-interferon sandwich ELISA. These results indicate that the anti-PEG sandwich
  ELISA was insensitive to PEGylation mediated epitope-masking and the sensitivity
  increased in proportion to the length of PEG. By contrast, PEG-masking interfered
  with detection by traditional anti-interferon sandwich ELISA. Human and mouse serum
  did not affect the sensitivity of anti-PEG ELISA but impeded traditional anti-interferon
  sandwich ELISA. The anti-PEG sandwich ELISA was comparable to anti-interferon sandwich
  ELISA and radioassay of 131I-Pegasys in pharmacokinetic studies in mice. The anti-PEG
  sandwich ELISA provides a sensitive, accurate, and convenient quantitative measurement
  of PEGylated protein drugs.
