Here, we describe a simple method to improve the detection limit and sensitivity of various immunoassays by mixing detection antibodies with a soluble poly protein G (named 8pG). 8pG was developed by fusing eight repeated fragment crystallizable (Fc) binding domains of streptococcal protein G to a linear polymer. Simply mixing detection antibodies with 8pG to form an antibody/8pG complex largely increased the accumulation of detection antibody to target molecules, which dramatically enhanced the sensitivity in direct ELISA, sandwich ELISA, Western blot, and flow cytometry systems, separately. The detection limit of Western blot for low-abundance PEGylated interferon (Pegasys) and recombinant human CTLA4 (rhCTLA4) improved by at least 13-fold and 31-fold, respectively, upon mixing detection antibodies with 8pG. Moreover, the nanoscale size of the antibody/8pG complex did not influence the granularity and dimension of target cells in the flow cytometry system. Collectively, we provide a quick and easy-to-operate method to make various immunoassays to sensitively detect low-abundance target molecules by just mixing their detection antibodies with 8pG.","tags":[],"title":"Simply Mixing Poly Protein G with Detection Antibodies Enhances the Detection Limit and Sensitivity of Immunoassays.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi-Jou Chen","Michael Chen","Yuan-Chin Hsieh","Yu-Cheng Su","Chang-Hung Wang","Chiu-Min Cheng","An-Pei Kao","Kai-Hung Wang","Jing-Jy Cheng","Kuo-Hsiang Chuang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605789535,"objectID":"4d2656f21ec285dae5d97fbaad6abb54","permalink":"https://michaelchen25.github.io/publication/chen-2018/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T12:38:54.895225Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The sensitivity of traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) is limited by the low binding avidity and heterogeneous orientation of capture antibodies coated on polystyrene-based microplates. Here, we developed a highly sensitive ELISA strategy by fixing poly-protein G-expressing cells on microplates to improve the coating amount and displayed orientation of capture antibodies. One or eight repeated fragment crystallisable (Fc) binding domains of protein G are stably expressed on the surface of BALB/c 3T3 cells (termed 1pG cells or 8pG cells), which then act as highly antibody-trapping microparticles. The 8pG cells showed higher antibody-trapping ability than the 1pG cells did. The antibody-coating amount of the 8pG cell-based microplates was 1.5–23 times and 1.2–6.8 times higher than that of traditional polystyrene-based and commercial protein G-based microplates, respectively. The 8pG cell-based microplates were then applied to an anti-IFN-$α$ sandwich ELISA and an anti-CTLA4 competitive ELISA, respectively, and dramatically enhanced their detection sensitivity. Importantly, direct coating unpurified capture antibody produced by mammalian cells did not impair the antigen-capturing function of 8pG cell-based microplates. The 8pG cell-based microplates exhibited a significant improvement in antibody-coating amount and preserved the homogeneous orientation of capture antibodies, making them a potential replacement for traditional microplates in various formats of ELISAs.","tags":[],"title":"Development of a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) through use of poly-protein G-expressing cell-based microplates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chia-Jung Lee","Chao-Ching Wang","Michael Chen","Kuo-Hsiang Chuang","Tian-Lu Cheng","Ting-Yan Jian","Yun-Ming Wang","Tse-Hung Huang","Kuang-Wen Liao","Shey-Cherng Tzou"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605789535,"objectID":"36e30bf10dce1a919d4fd04c7771fd40","permalink":"https://michaelchen25.github.io/publication/lee-2018/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T12:38:55.090896Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lee-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Development of an inflammatory tissue-selective chimeric TNF receptor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chia-Yu Su","Michael Chen","Ling-Chun Chen","Yuan-Soon Ho","Hsiu-O Ho","Shyr-Yi Lin","Kuo-Hsiang Chuang","Ming-Thau Sheu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605789535,"objectID":"fa05d0c85c2ea8948f0a68a31f2dc4d5","permalink":"https://michaelchen25.github.io/publication/su-2018/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T12:38:55.280837Z","relpermalink":"/publication/su-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bispecific antibodies (anti-mPEG/anti-HER2) for active tumor targeting of docetaxel (DTX)-loaded mPEGylated nanocarriers to enhance the chemotherapeutic efficacy of HER2-overexpressing tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Chen","Kai-Wen Cheng","Yi-Jou Chen","Chang-Hung Wang","Ta-Chun Cheng","Kuo-Chien Chang","An-Pei Kao","Kuo-Hsiang Chuang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605789535,"objectID":"a8822effa6590cc8a402c3760aec2215","permalink":"https://michaelchen25.github.io/publication/chen-2017/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T12:38:55.478895Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Intestinal bacterial $β$-glucuronidase ($β$G) hydrolyzes glucuronidated metabolites to their toxic form in intestines, resulting in intestinal damage. The development of a method to inhibit $β$G is thus important but has been limited by the difficulty of directly assessing enzyme activity in live animals. Here, we utilized a fluorescent probe, fluorescein di-$β$-D-glucuronide (FDGlcU), to non-invasively image the intestinal bacterial $β$G activity in nude mice. In vitro cell-based assays showed that the detection limit is 104 colony-forming units/well of $β$G-expressing bacteria, and that 7.81 ng/mL of FDGlcU is enough to generate significant fluorescent signal. In whole-body optical images of nude mice, the maximum fluorescence signal for $β$G activity in intestines was detected 3 hours after gavage with FDGlcU. Following pretreatment with a bacterial $β$G inhibitor, the fluorescence signal was significantly reduced in abdomens and excised intestines images. For a 4-day antibiotic treatment to deplete intestinal bacteria, the FDGlcU-based images showed that the $β$G activity was decreased by 8.5-fold on day 4 and then gradually increased after treatment stopped. The results suggested that FDGlcU-based imaging revealed the in vitro and in vivo activity of intestinal bacterial $β$G, which would facilitate pharmacodynamic studies of specific bacterial $β$G inhibitors in animal studies.","tags":[],"title":"Real-time imaging of intestinal bacterial -glucuronidase activity by hydrolysis of a fluorescent probe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wen-Rui Hao","Michael Chen","Yi-Jou Chen","Yu-Cheng Su","Chiu-Min Cheng","Hsiang-Yin Hsueh","An-Pei Kao","Yuan-Chin Hsieh","Johny Chang","Ming-Yang Tseng","Kuo-Hsiang Chuang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605789535,"objectID":"27d8401b392108555b1cd8b94b375b88","permalink":"https://michaelchen25.github.io/publication/hao-2017/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T12:38:55.670605Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hao-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The sensitivities of solid-phase immunoassays are limited by the quantity of detection antibodies bound to their antigens on the solid phase.

Eight tandemly repeated fragment crystallisable (Fc) binding domains of protein G were stably expressed on the surface of Escherichia coli BL21 cells (termed BL21/8G). BL21/8G cells showed a higher avidity for trapping antibodies on their surface than monomeric protein G-expressing BL21 (BL21/1G) cells did. In the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), simply mixing the detection antibody with BL21/8G provided a detection limit of 6 pg/mL for human interferon-$α$ (IFN-$α$) and a limit of 30 pg/mL for polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated IFN-$α$ (Pegasys), which are better than that of the traditional ELISA (30 pg/mL for IFN-$α$ and 100 pg/mL for Pegasys). Moreover, the sensitivity of the Western blot for low-abundance Pegasys (0.4 ng/well) was increased by 25 folds upon mixing of an anti-PEG antibody with BL21/8G cells.

However, PEGylation mediated epitope-masking may also limit sensitivity and accuracy of traditional ELISA. We previously described an anti-PEG-based sandwich ELISA for universal assay of PEGylated molecules. Here, we compared the quantitative assessment of PEGylated interferons by anti-PEG and traditional anti-interferon sandwich ELISA. The detection limits for PEG-Intron (12k-PEG) and Pegasys (40k-PEG) were 1.9 and 0.03 ng/mL for anti-PEG ELISA compared to 0.18 and 0.42 ng/mL for traditional anti-interferon sandwich ELISA. These results indicate that the anti-PEG sandwich ELISA was insensitive to PEGylation mediated epitope-masking and the sensitivity increased in proportion to the length of PEG. By contrast, PEG-masking interfered with detection by traditional anti-interferon sandwich ELISA. Human and mouse serum did not affect the sensitivity of anti-PEG ELISA but impeded traditional anti-interferon sandwich ELISA. The anti-PEG sandwich ELISA was comparable to anti-interferon sandwich ELISA and radioassay of 131I-Pegasys in pharmacokinetic studies in mice. The anti-PEG sandwich ELISA provides a sensitive, accurate, and convenient quantitative measurement of PEGylated protein drugs.","tags":[],"title":"Sensitivity of PEGylated interferon detection by anti-polyethylene glycol (PEG) antibodies depends on PEG length.","type":"publication"}]
